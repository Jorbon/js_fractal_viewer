# js_fractal_viewer
Renders mandelbrot and julia sets.

Spacebar centers the image on the mouse cursor, up and down arrow keys zoom by a factor of 2. J switches to the julia set that corresponds with the current mouse position in the mandelbrot set, and M returns to the mandelbrot set from a julia set. The image fills in gradually over time and is reset whenever the view is changed.
